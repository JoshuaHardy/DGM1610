8/28/19 I think I'm probably about done updating thsi log for the purposes of this repository. I have achieved the objective of this assignment by
learning how to pull, edit, push, stage commit, and push using a github repository.
It's dark outside, Messing around looking for tutorials on pluralsight and unity.com/learn
Still Dark, Still learning Unity. The unity videos have nice editing to them.
Editing for the Green Dot. I'm taking a look at the Homework, and I'm getting the feeling we're falling a little bit behind the intended course schedule.
Another Green Dot Edit. Sundays are busy. and it's hard to find the time to code and upload relevent info to github when I work 8 Hours and go to church. The weather today was rainy. 9/8/2019
